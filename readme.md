<h1>INTRODUCTION:</h1>
‘PeerCode Clash’ is an innovative platform designed to elevate the coding experience among friends and peers. Unlike traditional coding platforms that primarily focus on scheduled rated contests, PeerCode Clash encourages users to sharpen their skills through friendly challenges and contests that can be initiated at any time.
<h2>Key Features:</h2<>>
    1.<h3> On-Demand Challenges:</h3> Users can initiate challenges at any time, allowing them to engage in coding contests with friends spontaneously. This flexibility ensures that coding enthusiasm remains high, fostering a continuous learning environment.
    2. <h3>Problemset Focus:</h3> Recognizing the importance of mastering fundamental concepts, PeerCode Clash emphasizes the completion of problemset problems. Users can challenge their friends to solve a curated set of random problems within a specific problemset range, promoting a more systematic and comprehensive approach to learning.
    3. <h3>Randomized Problem Selection: </h3>Each challenge contest presents participants with a unique selection of problems from the chosen problemset range. This not only adds an element of surprise but also ensures a diverse learning experience, covering a broad spectrum of topics and difficulty levels.
    4. <h3>Friendly Competition:</h3> PeerCode Clash is designed to foster a sense of friendly competition among peers. Users can track their progress, compare submissions, and celebrate achievements, creating a motivating and collaborative coding community.
    5. <h3>Continuous Learning:</h3> By breaking away from the rigid schedule of rated contests, PeerCode Clash encourages continuous learning. Participants can challenge each other regularly, honing their coding skills and tackling new challenges at their own pace.

<h1>IMPLEMENTATION:</h1>
We have implemented the login and signup part using python flask. 
Search for users using Roll numbers.
Sending Challenge Request.
Redirecting them to the problem set.
The code for random problem generation is in a seperate folder(ps)

<h1>TO BE DONE:</h1>
we are short on time so we are left with the following :
we are left with integrating the various modules(questions mapping to the players) 
check for submissions of the players whether they solved that problem in the past and provide them with different ones.
Establishing more robust connection between client and server.
Storing History of the candidates, i.e. previous challenges and their results.
Maintaining profile of the user, i.e functionality to change/re-set passwords, view rating.



<h1>EXTENSIONS:</h1>

<ul>
<li>We can extend the 1v1 to multiplayer.they can use this to conduct local contests also.</li>
<li>we may also add rating and ranking feature to bring more competitiveness among peers.</li>
<li>We can upgrade the choosing of problems with including features like filters(number of questions,problem categories).</li>
<li>Instead of rigid contest duration players can choose the duration of contest, number of questions.</li>
<li>we can also assign daily challenges for our users awarding them with rating(jsut like in games).</li>
</ul>
